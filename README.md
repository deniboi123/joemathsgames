# JoeMathsGames

JoeMathsGames is a project that allows you to play games on your iPhone/iPad and download them without needing the App Store at all. Many of your favourite games, such as Classic Minecraft and others are on JoeMathsGames. Want to add your own games? Make an issue with your game, link and image and it will be added.

## How does it work?
It uses Apple's Webclip functionality, which works on most devices. Plus you dont need to Jailbreak your iPhone/iPad to use this software as it is a webapp put into an application.
